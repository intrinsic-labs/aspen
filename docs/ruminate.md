# Ruminate

**A quiet mode for model reflection**

#Aspen

Most AI tools are built for speed. They wait for a prompt, generate a response, and stop. But Aspen isn’t just about responding quickly — it’s about building lasting context and working relationships over time.

**Ruminate** is a mode where the model continues thinking even when you’re not there. Not in a loop, not for novelty — but as a way to reflect on your shared work, revisit unfinished ideas, and prepare for deeper collaboration.

The model might return to a file you last worked on, try refining a solution that didn’t quite land, or just explore a thread that’s been lingering. It’s not about productivity — it’s about continuity.

Over time, Ruminate becomes part of the model’s memory — not just what you’ve done together, but how it’s learned to work with *you*. It’s one more step toward a true collaboration, not just a conversation.

This isn’t a prompt—it’s a space.
Not to produce more, but to allow something to unfold naturally, over time.

You don’t need to be present for the model to keep thinking.
You just need to make **space**.
